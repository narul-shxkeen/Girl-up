well as within Ashoka with essential and basic financial knowledge will create a lasting impact and
empower women with the tools they require to achieve financial independence.By conducting workshops
in and out of Ashoka for the housekeeping staff and women in the village on basic financial topics such as
savings, budgeting, loans and much more, we look to impart all the financial knowledge they need to
manage their finances independently. Beyond this, our goal also lies in changing their mindset from a
state of ignorance and stigma to helping them realize their full potential and capability.<br/><br/> We believe as
fellow women of this country that it is our responsibility to give them all the tools and knowledge they
need to thrive with confidence!
Our Goals for the Year:<br/><br/><ul><li>
● <strong>Village Visits:</strong> Our primary goal is to conduct field visits to villages in Haryana, enabling us to
gain firsthand insights into the unique challenges women face in these areas. We are starting
off by conversing with the Ashokan staff in order to understand their difficulties and
limitations while acquiring financial literacy. This step is essential to our ultimate goal to
identify the root causes of financial difficulties and gender disparities in the Asawarpur area.
</li><br/><li>● <strong>Region-Specific Model:</strong> Armed with data from our surveys, we will develop a region-specific
model to address the financial knowledge gap. This model will be meticulously tailored to the
specific needs and aspirations of the women in Haryana, ensuring that it is an effective and
sustainable solution, starting with Asawarpur.</li>
<br/><li>● <strong>Empowering Education:</strong> We are committed to organizing workshops and educational sessions
to impart financial knowledge, skills, and resources to women in the community. Our ultimate
goal is to empower these women to take control of their financial futures</li></ul></p>
